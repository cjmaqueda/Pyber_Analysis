# Pyber_Analysis

Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis: 
  •	Correlation between total rides and fare price
    o	Urban = more rides, but shorter trips (i.e. lower $ fares)
    o	Rural = fewer rides, but longer trips (i.e. higher $ fares)
  •	Overall ride distribution heavily skewed towards urban environment 
  •	I would argue that there are new opportunities to expand Pyber business into rural communities (e.g. rural drivers account for only ~1% of driver population, but ~5% of total rides and ~7% of total fares)
    o	as well as into the suburban landscape, although less so than into the rural market
